### “What is Object oriented programming and what are its main advantages over Procedure Oriented Programming?”

(Note Philipp: I hope this was our final version. I messed something up trying to merge our fork with the upstream...)

Objective oriented programming (OOP) is a way of structuring computer code in a way that closely resembles the real world as we humans perceive it. This is achieved by organizing code into objects, which are characterized by their properties (data) and by the ways they can interact with other objects (functionality). Just like we tend to group the objects in the world around us into different categories, OOP is built on the idea that objects can belong to different “classes”. For example, some pets could be grouped into classes “cat” or “dog”. Each class is characterized by attributes and methods. Attributes are the features that can be used to describe the object, such as “name”, “owner” and “fur color”. For instance, my friend Erik’s dog Onyx would be an instance of the class “dog”, with the following data: {name: Onyx, owner: Erik, color: black}. Methods are the ways in which the object is able to interact with its environment. For example, an object of class “cat” can meow, hunt mice, and climb. An object of class “dog” can bark, sit, and beg for food.

Compared to procedure oriented programming (POP), the existence of classes and objects replaces large numbers of loops and conditional executions, and helps others understand the logic of the code more naturally. Thus, OOP code is more intuitive and easier to debug. Data is more secure in OOP as it is stored in objects and can only be used by specific methods in the class. It is possible to update programs written in OOP with greater flexibility, by adding new classes and functions. Therefore, with mild modifications, programs written in OOP can be used for a wide range of different problems.
